AIM: Design and deploy cotainers in Nginx  which can work as a load balancer/ reverse proxy and will ditribute traffic among various containers runs on same port , if one of container is down , other one is working. 

# DOCKER COMPOSE 

docker-compose up -d --build

docker ps -a


# app running on ec2 public ip 


# 2 containers are stopped ,  but one contianer remain in running state since contianer " bf1472535ea5 " is only one .
